# GRIDME

This project was an improbable one only couple of weeks ago. 
I was having hard times to get comfortable with `flexbox` , `grid` , and much more. But once you do not push yourself to your limits you can never undestand what can you do really. 
Gridme was very special when I was assigned to it and it special after finishing it.'


I remember the first time I used `Bootstrap`, it was the third version. It was so smart. I mean one can use and reuse the ready classes and as long as it meets the requirements, one small tweak here and there means you have a ready website already. Once when I used it, I was mesmarized with the idea.
Then this assignment came to play. It was openly asking me to create a very primordial framework, which works like the same `bootstrap` I really liked. 

I was hyped a lot. Was learning Scss and everytime I learn a new feature I was thinking how can I use it in my assignment.

It is finished now and I must say I am proud of it. It might be very weak, may be open to lots of optimizations, but  it works as minimum viable product as of now and I know that I can make it more muscular when I have time to do so.

This feeling is priceless..
