This is the final and the `boss` challenge of The Odin Project's HTML&CSS project . 
Actually this assignment is a two step one :



A) So far you used Bootstrap, Tailwind, Materialize etc, how about you come up with a framework (extremely minimal, of course) than can be repeteadly used? And hey,may it be a grid-based one. So the users can enjoy the might of the CSS grid.
The best practice is actually 7-1 encapsulation. Creating partial Scss files and storing them accordingly and using by importing. However, due to some problems I encountered with my IDE while I opted for single-file solution. You can find it at the top section of my [](scss/style.scss) file
